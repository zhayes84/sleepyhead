# Welcome to sleepyhead!
***sleepyhead*** is an attempt to organize my weekly schedule by properly preparing for adequate sleeping time. 

Please note this project is **completely** under construction and should not be used yet.

# Purpose
***sleepyhead*** began as a tool to solve the problems I faced in my work weeks such as:

 1. Varying times needed to be at work each day
 2. Being very busy and having poor time management skills

In order to solve these problems while furthering my Python learning, I'm setting out to create a tool that will do this mental modeling for me. 

# Desired End Result
A system to allow me to input: 

 1. Dates and times I need to be at work each day
 2. Commute time to each work location *(minutes/hours)*
 3. Time needed to prepare for work after waking up *(minutes/hours)*
 4. Desired number of hours to be in bed

Which will then output what time I need to go to bed each day to achieve `x` number of hours in bed each night. I personally aim for hours in bed vs hours of sleep because my sleep patterns vary wildly each night.

# To-Do

 - [ ] Add try/else/except/finally functionality to `departure()`, `bed_time()`, and `wake_up()`
 - [ ] Ability to output daily and/or weekly schedule to PDF
